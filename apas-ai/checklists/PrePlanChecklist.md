- [ ] Is the plan clearly understood? If not, get clarification from the user before proceeding.
- [ ] Are plan steps written as TODO items down to the specific files (or folders) that will be created or modified?
- [ ] Is it clear which new `src` files will be created and what each file should be named?
- [ ] Is it clear which existing `src` files the new work depends upon or must integrate with?
- [ ] Does the plan schedule creating each *Per file before the *Eph files?
- [ ] Does the plan schedule creating each file in its own step so files are generated one at a time?
- [ ] For every `src` file, does the plan list which methods will be implemented and which existing methods will be delegated to?
- [ ] If multiple `src` files are being added, are the tasks ordered bottom-up so incremental `cargo build` runs succeed after each file addition?
- [ ] Is it clear which data structures to create and their types?
- [ ] Do not use Vec for anything of known length, use a sequence type.
- [ ] Does the plan plan know which functions and methods in an Mt module are to be parallel?
- [ ] Does the plan schedule running the RustRules and APAS checklists after each new `src` file is created or edited?
- [ ] Does the plan schedule `cargo build` after each new `src` file, performed one at a time until the build is clean (no warnings/errors)?
- [ ] Is it clear which test files will be created?
- [ ] Does the plan schedule running the RustRules and APAS checklists after each new test file is created or edited?
- [ ] Are there uses of Vec that are of known length and should be a sequence type in the new files? Fix them.
- [ ] Does the plan schedule `cargo nextest` (targeting the new test file) after each test file is added, run one at a time until clean?
- [ ] Is it clear which benchmark files will be created?
- [ ] Does the plan schedule running the RustRules and APAS checklists after each new benchmark file is created or edited?
- [ ] Does the plan schedule `cargo bench` (targeting the new benchmark file) after each benchmark is added, run one at a time until clean?
- [ ] Does the plan document the current PSP step (process definition) and note that time/estimate tracking will be incorporated in future iterations?
- [ ] Does the plan include a full `cargo build` at the end of the work?
- [ ] Does the plan include a full `cargo nextest` run at the end of the work?
- [ ] Does the plan reserve a final step to summarize the changes and call out any outstanding issues?
- [ ] Estimate the time to execute this plan.
- [ ] If the user says 'Execute relentlessly without pause' can you for this plan?
- [ ] Add a step of running the the AlgorithmicAnalaysis to the rules/AlgorithmicAnalysisRules.md.
- [ ] Add the last step of running the PostPlanChecklist.
