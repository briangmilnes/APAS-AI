 Chap 18 is still running sequentially in places:
            if n < 1000 {
                // Sequential for small arrays
                let mut values: Vec<U> = Vec::with_capacity(n);
                for i in 0..n {
                    values.push(f(&a.nth_cloned(i)));
                }
                ArraySeqMtEphS::from_vec(values)
            } else {
                // Parallel for large arrays
                let mid = n / 2;
                let left = a.subseq_copy(0, mid);

 Check that all *Mt files are truely parallel in Chap18.
 Chap18 needs algorithmic analysis on all files after this.
