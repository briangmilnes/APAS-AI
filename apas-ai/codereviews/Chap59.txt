 Why is there a mod.rs?
 What do the rules say about that?

 You put Rayon in, what do the APAS rules say about that?
 Replace with fork/join.

 The uses look wildly too big:

    use crate::Chap05::SetStEph::SetStEph::*;
    use crate::Chap06::LabDirGraphMtEph::LabDirGraphMtEph::LabDirGraphMtEphTrait;
    use crate::Chap06::LabDirGraphStEph::LabDirGraphStEph::*;
    use crate::Chap06::WeightedDirGraphMtEphInt::WeightedDirGraphMtEphInt::*;
    use crate::Chap06::WeightedDirGraphStEphInt::WeightedDirGraphStEphInt::*;
    use crate::Chap19::ArraySeqStEph::ArraySeqStEph::*;
    use crate::Chap56::AllPairsResultStEphInt::AllPairsResultStEphInt;
    use crate::Chap57::DijkstraStEphInt::DijkstraStEphInt::dijkstra;
    use crate::Chap58::BellmanFordStEphInt::BellmanFordStEphInt::bellman_ford;
    use crate::Types::Types::*;

 Which are actually needed?
 
 The files have APAS work/span but not your deductions on work/span. Please add these.
