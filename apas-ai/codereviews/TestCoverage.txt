 There is standard rust too to check test coverage.
 Explain it to me.
 How hard is it to run?
 Estimate what our test coverage is now?
 Can this be run chapter by chapter?
 How many tests do we have now?

 Which modules are untested? List them skipping Examples and Problems.

 Make a plan to fix these issues according to PrePlanChecklist.
 Show it to the user in todos.
 Do not proceed until she reviews it.


 Identifying the modules, with zero  or very low test coverage, I see
the following.

Chap19/ArraySeqMtEph.rs
Chap19/ArraySeqMtPer.rs
Types.rs
main.rs
Chap55/TopoSortStPer.rs
Chap55/TopoSortStEph.rs
Chap55/SCCStPer.rs
Chap55/SCCStEph.rs
Chap55/CycleDetectStPer.rs

Chap45/LeftistHeapPQ.rs
Chap45/HeapsortExample.rs
Chap06/WeightedUnDirGraphStEphInt.rs
Chap06/WeightedUnDirGraphStEphFloat.rs

 Start by listing the those with no test file.
 Write tests for them, get them compiling, and run them.
