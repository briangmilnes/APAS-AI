 Which files are missing APAS annotations for work and span?

 List them all.

 Can any be fixed by the ChapNN.txt files that contain
 just algorithm analysis text from APAS in 
 promts/alganl?

 Make a plan according to PrePlanChecklist to fix these.
 As they are comments you can avoid building src, checking
 tests and benches/ until one final sweep of just cargo build.
