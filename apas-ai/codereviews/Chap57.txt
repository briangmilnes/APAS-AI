//! **Algorithmic Analysis:**
//! - `new`: Work O(1), Span O(1)
//! - `push`: Work O(1) amortized, Span O(1) amortized
//! - `pop`: Work O(1) amortized, Span O(1) amortized
//! - `peek`: Work O(1), Span O(1)
//! - `is_empty`: Work O(1), Span O(1)
//! - `size`: Work O(1), Span O(1)

And again.
//! **Algorithmic Analysis:**
//! - Dijkstra: Work O(m log n), Span O(m log n) where m = |E|, n = |V|
