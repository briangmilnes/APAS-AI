Our imports should have:
1) A blank line after the pub mod
2) All rust library imports.
3) A blank line.
4) Our imports with Types first.


It should look like this:
pub mod <MODULE> {

    use std::cmp::{max, min};
    use std::fmt::{Debug, Display};
    use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
    use std::thread;

    use crate::Types::Types::*;
    use crate::Chap18::ArraySeqMtPer::ArraySeqMtPer::*;
... 

And anywhere you are including the same named module
from two chapters such as

    use crate::Chap18::ArraySeqStEph::ArraySeqStEph::{ArraySeqStEphS, ArraySeqStEphTrait};
    use crate::Chap37::AVLTreeSeqStEph::AVLTreeSeqStEph::{AVLTreeSeqStEphS, AVLTreeSeqStEphTrait};
has to be wrong. It should only use the last numbered module, 37 in this case.

Make a plan according to PrePlanChecklist to fix this. 
Be sure to compile after each file change.
Then be sure to compile and run the tests and the benchmarks, but don't run the benchmarks.
Show it to the user.
