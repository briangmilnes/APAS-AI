 Make a plan to sweep all the src, tests and benches looking for
 imports like

    use crate::Types::Types::*;
    use crate::Chap18::ArraySeqStEph::ArraySeqStEph::{ArraySeqStEphS, ArraySeqStEphTrait};
    use crate::Chap37::AVLTreeSeqStEph::AVLTreeSeqStEph::{AVLTreeSeqStEphS, AVLTreeSeqStEphTrait};
    use crate::Chap41::AVLTreeSetStEph::AVLTreeSetStEph::{AVLTreeSetStEph, AVLTreeSetStEphTrait};

 In which you are importing multiple copies of the same datastructure.

 The plan should be to PrePlanChecklist and in todos.
 With per file compilation and test compilation but do not run the tests.
 Build the benchmarks but do not run them.

 At the end just do a cargo bench --no-run.
