 Make a plan to sweep all the src, tests and benches looking for
 imports like

    use crate::Chap37::AVLTreeSeqStEph::AVLTreeSeqStEph::{AVLTreeSeqStEphS, AVLTreeSeqStEphTrait};
    use crate::Chap41::AVLTreeSetStEph::AVLTreeSetStEph::{AVLTreeSetStEph, AVLTreeSetStEphTrait};

 In which you are importing multiple copies of the same datastructure.

 Write a script to find these. Show me what it finds?

 Write another script that finds use like
  use crate::Chap41::AVLTreeSetStEph::AVLTreeSetStEph::{AVLTreeSetStEph, AVLTreeSetStEphTrait};
  or say Type::B, N...

 show me what it finds. 

Write script sto fix key pattern 1, another to fix key pattern 2 and key pattern 3. 
Run the first one then build. 
When that works,
run the second one then build.
When that works, run a script to fix key pattern 3 and cargo build.


 Check for use ...{X as Y}.

 Write a script to find these.

 Propose a plan to fix these.
 The default should be to use import X and change the UFCS on Y to X.
