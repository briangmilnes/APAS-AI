 Make a plan to PrePlanChecklist to do the following:

 Run the benchmarks one by one to check these criteria:

 Are all of the benchmarks running with 300ms warmup?
 Are all of the benchmarks running with 1s total time?
 Do all of them have their input sizes adjusted to that
  they can complete in about 1s?
 Do they all run without warnings?

 Then run a final full benchmark and check the criteria.

 Note that cargo bench is now forking too many rustc and
 should be run -j 10. This has been added to the
 ExecutionStyle rules.
