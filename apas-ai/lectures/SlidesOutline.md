# Introduction
1. Hi, I'm Brian Milnes, computer scientist and entrepreneur.
2. CMU Math/CS undergraduate.
3. CMU CS Research Programmer 9 years.
4. Founding member at Lycos, a search engine that you probably don't know.
5. Early into Amazon.
6. M.Sc. Computer Science UW with some amazing classes.
7. Then on the founding team at Zillow. 
8. And a long term fan of proofs of programs.

# I am hoping for a lot of interactions!
1. I am not going to catch the ducks! It's too slow.
2. Just throw them at me, I have glasses.
3. Don't wait for me to call on you, yell it out!
4. I'm going to ask a bunch of How Many Questions, raise your hands for a count.

# Some How Manys
1. How many of you have programmed in C?
2. How many of you have programmed in Rust?
3. How many of you have programmed in Python?
4. How many of you have programmed in Java?
5. How many of you have programmed in Lisp?
6. How many of you have programmed in ML or OCaml?
7. How many of you have programmed in done a proof of programs on paper?
8. How many of you have programmed in done a proof of programs in a formal system?
9. Any of you doing a math degree also? Any logic?

# AI Research
1. Built an AI expert system programming language (CRL-OPS).
2. It integrated schema languages (think object oriented programming)
  with forward chaining resoning.
3. Worked on AI planning and learning systems in Soar for Allen Newell.
4. Specified Soar in an early formal language: Z so we
 actually knew what it was doing.
5. Before that the research papers and the code was the model,
  which is not very good for research.
6. Just schema style validation, no code generation, no proof.
7. In order to learn these techniques and to be able to better
 estimate my work, I took most of the M.Sc. in Software Engineering
 at the CMU Software Engineering Institute.

# Allen Newell
1. A founder of Computer Science, 2nd degree (first was Herb Simon).
2. A founder of Artificial Intelligence.
3. A founder of Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Modelling.
4. Predicted that theorems would be automatically proven in a few years in 1956.
5. Designed Soar, a learning and planning Cognitive Architecture with his students.
6. He and Scott Fahlman (Common Lisp, Connectionist learning and reinvented the :))
 argued to get Hinton on CMU Faculty. And it was close.

# PL Research
1. Robert Harper - One of the top programming language semantics researchers. 
     Designed and proved the ML module system. Latest great result is a 'cublical'
     semantics for programming languages.
2. Frank Pfenning - Logic programming, various PL semantics, Higher Order Abstract Syntax,
   proofs of programming semantics in logic frameworks.
3. Peter Lee - Proof Carrying Code is amongst his best work, but not heavily used.
   Now heads Microsoft Research Labs. Just did the best UW CSE guest lecture that I have
   ever seen.
4. Fox Project - could we use an advanced programming language for systems programming.
5. FoxNet - we rebuild TCP/IP in SML and it was amazing. Lately referred to as "The Traditional Approach".
6. My favorite part was making a DNS server that read just like the IETF standard (RFC).
7. As I worked on programming languages, I studied for an M.Sc. in Logic and Computation.
8. My thesis was on conditional compilation. Necessity is the mother of invention.
9. Alas I got sucked up into the internet.

# Internet 
1. In 1995 I got drafted into Lycos, an early search engine company.
2. I ran operations including lots of software development for it.
3. There were very few software systems for monitoring large scale
 clustering.
4. Why did Google kick Lycos's ass? 
5. Random graph walk ordering instead of citation ordering for pages.
6. Managed over $150 M in purchasing for computer systems and their
support.
7. And many person years of programming (hint: managing programmers
may now be key to your success, even if they are not human).

# Amazon
1. In 1997 I got sucked into Amazon, very early.
2. I ended up being their systems engineer and ran
 their performance lab for years.
3. In those days there were very few performance tools,
 I had to build unique tools and processes.
4. I had many long long days dealing with multiple systems outages
and hacks to Amazon, including front page New York Times outage articles.
5. I would rather have been purely programming, but operations skilled
 engineers were few and far between.

# Zillow
1. In 2006 I joined the very young Zillow real estate site and ran operations.
4. I ran their database group.
5. Zillow was best described as: Data Porn for the Middle Aged.
6. I was excoriated on the front page of the Seattle Times for
 an outage on our launch day!
7. Marketing estimated L load.
8. I designed and proved 3 x L load, it's a step function of cost to build systems.
9. We got 5 x L Load.
10. In 45 minutes we reconfigured and were up at 6 x L.
11. Purchased over $2M in electricity alone. In fact we ran out several times.
12. I was the 5th customer of AWS. It took all of 2 minutes to say Yes. 
  We re-Zestimated the world in two weeks.

# Why am I working in AI paired programming?
1. Because it's a programmer's dream come true.
2. We all knew back in the 80s that someday programming would 
 change amazlingly.
3. And because it is critical now for computer security and
 programming languages.

# You're about to have a fascinating career!
1. What do you think your career will be like?
2. Will Professor Ernst have a job?
3. Will you have a job?
4. What will be different between your careers and mine?
5. What other giant change is coming?
6. Quantum Computing 
7. Has it really achieved quantum supremecy? 

# Peter Lee lecture
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEovhfxJsM4 
2. This is the best UW CSE Colloquium I have ever seen.
2. 1:05 I asked a question.
3. How much code do you need to train these models?
4. Are we going to have Python forever?
5. And Peter's answer is amazing.

# So what did I do next?
1. I had Chat-GPT-4 look into the Linux code base for me.
2. And list the binary parsers (see EverParse later).
3. And it know so much about it I was blown away.
4. So I asked it to summarize the tenets of the Orange
 Catholic religion in the Dune novels.
5. And it skipped one. Can anyone guess which one?
6. Thou shalt not make machines that think like people!
7. Try it now? Why is it answering that?

# How much code is needed to train your LLM on a new langauge?
1. Gpt-4 at this time could write OK F* code with 500 KLOC.
2. But it could not write proofs.
3. It could not get syntax even right.
4. BTW I am very very careful about what I write in email to Peter.
5. And I think he actually reads them.
6. I am going to disagree with Peter here. 
7. This is a very dangerous thing to do, as he's whip smart.
7. When I disagree later with him, point this out to me!

# Blood on the Highway
1. AI LLMs are very very dangerous.
2. At various companies, I gave the "Blood on the Highway" lecture.
 An analogy to the driving school warnings lectures and movies.
3. "If anyone builds it, everbody dies" is a warning.
https://www.amazon.com/Anyone-Builds-Everyone-Dies-Superhuman/dp/0316595640
4. https://superintelligence-statement.org/
5. You'll have to watch this but we're just going to say that it's 
 really dangerous and not go into any depth here except for it's affects
 on computer security and programming languages.
6. What's the most dangerous thing you can think of to do with an AI?
7. Design a new killer virus hooked up to a robot lab.
8. Has covid has aready been redesigned with acquired lethality?
  No public data but rumours.

# APAS
1. "Algorithms Parallel and Sequential" Acar and Blelloch is
 a great fundamental textbook on algorithms.
2. https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15210/docs/book.pdf
3. I decided that it had enough fundamental algorithms in it,
in enough detail, that I could implement it.
4. And it had no formal proofs. 
5. There are a few algorithms textbooks with some formal
 proofs, but they're not very rich.
