FILES WITH REDUNDANT CHAP NAMES IN FILENAMES
==============================================

Note: AVL* files should be in Chap37, not Chap19 as previously stated.

SUMMARY:
========
- Total files with redundant Chap names: 25
- Files also in wrong chapter directory: 8 (all the Chap18 files currently in Chap19)
- Need to create Chap18 directories for: src/, tests/, benches/

CORRECTED AVL INFORMATION:
=========================
AVL* files should be moved to Chap37 (not Chap19 as previously stated):
- All AVLTreeSeq* files in src/, tests/, benches/ should go to Chap37/
- This includes both base AVLTreeSeq files and their Chap18/Chap19 variants
