 Are any test files directly importing both Chap18 and Chap19?

 Is it because the file is too broad and testing both or is
 it because it's using something from 18 that is not in 19?

 List the files and classify them as above.

 Make plan to fix them.


 Go through each test file and check that all public fn and
 methods are tested and which tests call things that no
 longer exist.

 Make list per file and a plan to fix them.
