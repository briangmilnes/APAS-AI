 Look at every where in the src and think 
 about if it is redundant.

 Are some of these because StT is not in use?

 List the files and lines.

 Make a plan to remove those that can be.

 Let me inspect it.

 Then fix them, compiling or testing at each file.


 
 Make a HashFunClone of HashFunction and Clone in types.

 Sweep Chap47 minimizing Where clauses using this addition
 to RustRules.

#### Type Creation Traits (align with baseline)
#### Function argument bounds without where-clauses (new)
- Prefer inline generic bounds directly on the function’s generic parameters and arguments; avoid trailing `where` clauses unless:
  - The bounds are too long to read inline, i.e., over  120 characters, you may put in a Where clause.
  - You need higher-ranked trait bounds/lifetimes making inline form unreadable.
- For methods returning sequence types, put the element bound inline on the method generic: `fn map<U: StT + Clone>(...) -> Seq<U>` not `fn map<U>(...) -> Seq<U> where U: StT + Clone`.
- For inherent/trait methods that repeat a single bound across many items in the same impl, hoist to the impl header per the hoisting rules above; otherwise keep inline.
