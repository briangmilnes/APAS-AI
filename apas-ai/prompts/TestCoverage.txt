 First, go through all the source files, listing them,
 and confirming that each has a test file and it is
 in the right directory.

 Second, for each file and each pub fun or method in
 any trait list which are tested or not.

 Third, 

 Chap23/BBTEph.rs should be renamed BBTStEph. Fix all test and benches file naming and
 and import paths. Rerun test and benches (on that file) and fix any errors.
 

When test coverage work completes a batch:
 1. Run coverage analysis
 2. Identify next 30 lowest-coverage files
 3. Create new TODO list
 4. Execute it immediately
 5. Repeat until all modules have coverage >= 90% or I explicitly say stop.
 6. Expect diminishing returns as we are closing in on coverage.
 7. If you have to make a lot of test changes, don't worry about
  reporting status early. These are non-destructive low costs changes.
