 Make a src/Chap11/FibonacciMt, test and benchmark code.
 Show me the module in a text box before I let you save it.

 Don't build or run test as there is another AI running.

 Example 11.10 (Parallel Fibonacci in SPARC). Using SPARC, we can write the parallel

Fibonacci function as

fib x =
if x ≤ 1 then
x
else
let (ra, rb) = (fib (x − 1)) || (fib (x − 2)) in
ra + rb
end
