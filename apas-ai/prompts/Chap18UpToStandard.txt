 Now fix up: 

ls -1 src/Chap18
ArraySeqMtEph.rs
ArraySeqMtPer.rs
LinkedListStEph.rs
LinkedListStPer.rs

to match APAS ordering, traits and impl.

Remember they are stand alone and should not be importing any other files.
*Per has no set/update copy does not slice.
Run cargo build and only look at errors reported in Chap18,
tee it into a file it's still too big.

Fix any issues, KISS it.

Execute relentlessly.
