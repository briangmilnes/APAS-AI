When working with graphs, we sometimes wish to refer to parts of a graph. To this end,
we can use the notion of a subgraph, which refers to a graph contained in a larger graph.
A subgraph can be defined as any subsets of edges and vertices that together constitute a
well defined graph.
Definition 6.18 (Subgraph). Let G = (V, E) and H = (V ′, E′) be two graphs. H is a
subgraph of if V ′ ⊆ V and E′ ⊆ E.
Note. Note that since H is a graph, the vertices defining each edge are in the vertex set V ′,
i.e., for an undirected graph E′ ⊆ (V ′
2
). There are many possible subgraphs of a graph.
An important class of subgraphs are vertex-induced subgraphs, which are maximal sub-
graphs defined by a set of vertices. A vertex-induced subgraph is maximal in the sense that
it contains all the edges that it can possibly contain. In general when an object is said to be
a maximal “X”, it means that nothing more can be added to the object without violating
the property “X”.
Definition 6.19 (Vertex-Induced Subgraph). The subgraph of G = (V, E) induced by V ′ ⊆
V is the graph H = (V ′, E′) where E′ = {{u, v} ∈ E | u ∈ V ′, v ∈ V ′}
