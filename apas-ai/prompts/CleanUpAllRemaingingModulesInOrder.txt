Apply the clean up plan and then doit after each file, to the following Files in order, including their Test and Benchmark files.
Give me an ETA for each file clean up and doit and it's actual time before you start on each file.

Non-stop mode: execute the full todo list in order. Do not pause for review or approval. Only stop on a blocking compile/test failure.  After each file: run doitall, mark the todo, and give a one-line status.


The order of TO-DOs is:
Clean up ArraySeqPerChap19.rs and its test and benchmark files. Show all file changes with git diff as you make them. Then doit when you have the changes in.  
Clean up ArraySeqEph.rs and its test and benchmark files. Show all file changes with git diff as you make them. Then doit when you have the changes in.

Show me the full to-do list before you start.
And give me an ETA for the whole thing.
Be sure to mark each todo as it is done so I can track your progress.
