 How many of our core modules in src do not have a *Lit! macro? List them.

 Add a MathSeqLit! to MathSeq.rs.

  Look for macros in src that are not of the name <Module>Lit! and fix
 them and the test and bench code. Be sure to leave or place the macros
 and their test code in the module. Execute relentlessly.

Now scan tests for the old macro names and replace them with the new names. Then cargo nextest run.
Then scan benches for the old macro names and replace them with the new names. Then cargo bench.
Execute relentlessly.


I've just done this naming wrong.

The macros should be named for each <pub struct <X>> there should be an <X>Lit macro.
Go through all of the src files and list for each which macros should be in there marking them present, badly named or missing.
Estimate the task time.


Make a plan with to-dos to sweep the tests files using the new macros.
Look carefully at each use of Vec? Can it be replaced with a macro?

Find and list all of the Lit! macros.
Find those that do not have a test file and list them.
You may not fix any other test bugs not change src files in this sweep.

Make a plan in todos down to the file. Don't later decide to change it to batch it.

Each of these three tasks should have a separate todo per file.
1) Add the Lit! macro test and of course it's uses.
2) compile that changed test file. Fix any problems.
3) run that change test file. Fix any problems.

At the end run all the tests.

Show me the plan in a todo window and wait for me to review it before executing.
