 How many of our core modules in src do not have a *Lit! macro? List them.

 Add a MathSeqLit! to MathSeq.rs.

  Look for macros in src that are not of the name <Module>Lit! and fix
 them and the test and bench code. Be sure to leave or place the macros
 and their test code in the module. Execute relentlessly.
