 How many of our core modules in src do not have a *Lit! macro? List them.

 Add a MathSeqLit! to MathSeq.rs.

  Look for macros in src that are not of the name <Module>Lit! and fix
 them and the test and bench code. Be sure to leave or place the macros
 and their test code in the module. Execute relentlessly.

Now scan tests for the old macro names and replace them with the new names. Then cargo nextest run.
Then scan benches for the old macro names and replace them with the new names. Then cargo bench.
Execute relentlessly.


I've just done this naming wrong.

The macros should be named for each <pub struct <X>> there should be an <X>Lit macro.
Go through all of the src files and list for each which macros should be in there marking them present, badly named or missing.
Estimate the task time.


Make a plan with to-dos to sweep the tests files using the new macros.
Look carefully at each use of Vec? Can it be replaced with a macro?
