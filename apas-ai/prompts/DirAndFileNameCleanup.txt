How many where clauses can be obviated?

I see:

scripts/CountWhere.sh
src wheres
314
tests wheres
1
benches wheres
0
Total wheres
23

How many did you get rid of?

How many fn name(...)s now fit with return type in 120 chars
that you did not simplify? 

 Make a plan according to checklist/PrePlanChecklist.md
to simplify the wheres, down to the file.
Show it to me in TO-DO box.



Benches are still too long.

and lots of fn name(F...)
where F: <something that should be a type abreviation>.
