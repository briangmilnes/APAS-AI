We are going to restructure by adding chapter specific subdirectories.
Do not create mod.rs. 
Do simple imports like for 
pub mod Chap3 {
    pub mod InsertionSortSt;   
}
in lib.rs. 

Under no circumstance create old mod.rs or Chap<N>.rs files.

Do not sweep for path changes in src, tests and benches until I say
so later. This will save time. 


Show me the output of all cargo commands in a program box.
Show me a to-do list before you start and estimate time.

Leave Types at the top level as it is used so much.

src/Types.rs

make src, tests, benches Chap5 subdirectory.

move src/SetStEphChap5_1.rs 
     src/RelationStEphChap5_2.rs
     src/MappingStEphChap5_5.rs
     src/DirGraphStEphChap6_1.rs 
     src/UnDirGraphStEphChap6_1.rs

into Chap5 and its
tests and benches files into Chap5. 

Then, sweep for and change use paths and any UFCSs calls in
src.

Run cargo build and get it clean. 

Then, sweep for and change use paths and any UFCSs calls in
tests.

Run cargo nextest run and get it clean.

Then, sweep for and change use paths and any UFCSs calls in
benches. 

Run cargo bench file by file please and get them clean.


Whoops, I put some Chap6 files in Chap5.
     src/DirGraphStEphChap6_1.rs 
     src/UnDirGraphStEphChap6_1.rs

Fix that.



Rename these without the Chap6_1:
DirGraphStEphChap6_1.rs
UnDirGraphStEphChap6_1.rs

Change the module, trait and impl names.
Sweep this through src, tests, and benches.
Show me a to-do list and and estimate and
I'll tell you when to start.
