  So we have a serious set of defects on algorithmic analysis.
  The early chapters I did do not have the APAS alg anal recorded.

  Read rules/AlgorithmicAnalysisRules.md.

  Search src and see which modules do not have both
  an alg anal from APAS and from you.

  Some started to go on multiple lines with a jejune comment
  about O(1) - constant ...
  List these.

  At first I was having you comment them on both the trait
  function and methods and the impl. I no longer want them
  commented on the impls.

  List all of these files.

  Some APAS alg anal are recorded in 
  ~/APASVERUS/APAS-AI/apas-ai/prompts/alganal/ChapDD.txt
  just the analyses.

  Many are in the full text of the chapters in 
 ~/APASVERUS/APAS-AI/apas-ai/prompts/ChapDD.txt.

  Make a todo list on all those that you can fix with
  from those two sources (and the bad comments above).

  There should be one TODO per file to read and comment in the
  APAS alg anal.

  There should be another following the above TODO per file to read and comment in the
  your algorithmic analysis.

  And remember bug lines when they differ.
