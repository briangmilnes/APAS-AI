costs as follows.
Operation Work and Span
length a 1
expose a 1
join(Zero) or join(One(x)) 1
join(Two(L, R)) 1 + |r(L) − r(R)|
Hence the cost of joining two trees is proportional the absolute value of the difference of
their ranks.
Note that there is no parallelism in these operations. Parallelism will be used in building
the sequence functions from them.
