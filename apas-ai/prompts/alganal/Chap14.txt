Common Cases. By convention, and in common use, we use the following names:
linear : O(n)
sublinear : o(n)
quadratic : O(n2)
polynomial : O(nk), for any constant k.
superpolynomial : ω(nk), for any constant k.
logarithmic : O(lg n)
polylogarithmic : O(lgk n), for any constant k.
exponential : O(an), for any constant a > 1.


Definition 14.2 (O, Ω, Θ, o, ω Notation). Consider the set of all numeric functions F , and
f ∈ F . We define the following sets:
Name Definition Intuitively
big-O : O(f ) = {g ∈ F such that f dominates g} ≤ f
big-Omega : Ω(f ) = {g ∈ F such that g dominates f } ≥ f
big-Theta : Θ(f ) = O(f ) ∩ Ω(f ) = f
little-o : o(f ) = O(f ) \ Ω(f ) < f
little-omega : ω(f ) = Ω(f ) \ O(f ) > f

Subsets. We can use big-O (Ω, Θ) on both the left and right-hand sides of an equation. In
this case we are indicating that one set of functions is a subset of the other. For example,
consider Θ(n) ⊂ O(n2). This equation indicates that the set of functions on the left-hand
side is contained in the set on the right hand side. Again, sometimes “=” is used instead
of “⊂”.
