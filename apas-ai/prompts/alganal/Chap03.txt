Example 2.9. The parallel mergeSort function described in is work efficient since it does
O(n log n) work, which optimal time for comparison based sorting

Cost Specification 3.5 (Priority Queue: Basic). The work and span of a priority queue
operations are as follows.
• empty: O(1), O(1).
• insert: O(log n), O(log n).
• removeMin: O(log n), O(log n).


Example 3.2 (Cost of Insertion Sort). Considering insertion sort example, suppose that we
are given a cost specification for insert: for a sequence of length n the cost of insert
should be O(n) work and O(log n) span. We can then determine the overall asymptotic
cost of sort using our composition rules described in Section (Work, Span, and Parallel
4. IMPLEMENTATION 11
Time) . Since the code uses insert sequentially and since there are n inserts, the algorithm
insSort has n × O(n) = O(n2) work and n × O(log n) = O(n log n) span
