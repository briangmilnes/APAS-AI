 First, go through all the source files, listing them,
 and confirming that each has a bench file and it is
 in the right directory.

 Second, move any benchmark files to the right directories.
 Be sure to update Cargo.toml for this.

 Third, for each file and each pub fun or method in
 any trait list which are benched or not.
 Mark each fn or method as worth benching or not, for
 example, isEmpty, or is already benched.
 
 Fourth, make a plan with each file and fun or method
 getting its own todo to add the necessary benchmarks.
 Keep the benchmarks of each  function to 1 sec.

 After each file modification run the new benchmark
 (just the new one if you can, the file if you must). 
 Fix any errors. Warmups should be 100 ms.

 Then run all the benchmarks in that modified file
 and get all of the benchmarks running at about 1 sec.

 What are all the 'consider adding' benchmarks?
