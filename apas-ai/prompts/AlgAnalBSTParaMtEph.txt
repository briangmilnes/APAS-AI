 Put APAS's algorithmic analysis into BSTParMtEph.
 One line per Trait function typing and one line per
 impl function. 

 In // APAS - work ..., span .. lines.
 Perform you own and add it as
    // gpt-5-codex-medium: work ..., span ... lines.
 Note a //BUG APAS and gpt-5-codex-medium disagree for each disagreement.

 Write a todo, give an estimate and then proceed relentlessly.

Cost Specification 38.11 (BSTs). The BST cost specification is defined as follows. The vari-
ables n and m are defined as n = max (|t1|, |t2|) and m = min (|t1|, |t2|) when applicable.
Here, |t| denotes the size of the tree t, defined as the number of keys in t.
