Decrease steps are:
   1) Run the benchmark timed out at 10s.
   2) If it does not complete, cut its input by 8 fold.
   3) If it does complete > 1s, cut its input by T/10.
   3) If it does complete < 1s go on to the next one.
   4) Go back to step 1 until it completes in < 1s.

Increase:
   1) Run the benchmark timed out at 10s.
   2) If it does not complete, cut it by T/s. 
   3) If it does complete > 1s, cut its input by T/10.
   3) If it does complete < 1s go on to the next one.
   4) Go back to step 1 until it completes in < 1s.
 

Optimize:
   1) Run the benchmark timed out at 10s.
   2) If it completes < 500 ms then double it's
   inputs and go to 1.


 Make a plan with todos for each single benchmark in order.
 The todos are:
   Decrease
   
 Show me the plan in todos.
 
 Run the whole benchmark suite and time it out at #benchmarks (not files)
 * 5 s.

 Make a todo per benchmark, not file, to:
  Optimize.
