AVLTreeSeqMtPer Parallelism Analysis
====================================

File: src/Chap37/AVLTreeSeqMtPer.rs

Parallel Operations (now implemented):
--------------------------------------

1. build_balanced_from_slice<T>
   - Uses ParaPair! macro for parallel recursive construction
   - Left and right subtrees are built in parallel
   - Work: O(n), Span: O(lg n)
   
2. subseq_copy(start, length)
   - Uses std::thread::scope with one thread per element
   - Each thread extracts its element independently
   - Uses Arc<Mutex<Option<T>>> for safe concurrent writes to indexed positions
   - Work: O(n), Span: O(lg n) where n = length
   
3. from_vec(values)
   - Delegates to build_balanced_from_slice (which is now parallel)
   - Constructs balanced AVL tree from vector in parallel
   - Work: O(n), Span: O(lg n)

Sequential Operations (remain sequential):
-----------------------------------------

1. inorder_collect(&node, &mut Vec<T>)
   - Must visit nodes in order (left, root, right)
   - Used by values_in_order() which returns ordered Vec
   - Inherently sequential due to ordering requirement
   - Could potentially be parallelized with parallel merge, but Vec output maintains order
   
2. length() / nth(i)
   - Tree traversal operations
   - Could be parallelized but overhead likely not worth it for single element access
   
3. set(index, value)
   - Path copying for persistence
   - Sequential tree path traversal
   - Parallelizing would require significant restructuring

Summary:
--------
The most expensive operations (tree construction and subsequence extraction) are now
parallel. The remaining sequential operations are either inherently ordered (inorder_collect)
or involve single-element operations where parallelism overhead would exceed benefits.

Overall Assessment: AVLTreeSeqMtPer is now appropriately parallel for its key operations.
