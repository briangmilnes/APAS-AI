# APAS Analysis Outputs

This directory contains analysis outputs, reports, and summaries generated during development and testing of the APAS project.

## Directory Structure

### benchmarks/
Benchmark performance analysis results:
- `benchmark_results.txt` - Benchmark test results
- `working_benchmark_results.txt` - Working/current benchmark data

### coverage/
Code coverage analysis and reports:
- `coverage_analysis.txt` - Coverage analysis summary
- `method_coverage.txt` - Method-level coverage report
- `method_coverage_complete.txt` - Complete method coverage analysis
- `coverage/` - HTML coverage reports (generated by cargo-llvm-cov)

### code_quality/
Code quality audits and rule analysis:
- `mt_parallelism_audit.txt` - Multi-threaded parallelism audit
- `programmable_rules_analysis.md` - Analysis of which rules can be automated

### implementation/
Implementation summaries and documentation:
- `EXECUTION_RULES_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of execution rules simplification and test coverage implementation

### todos/
Project tracking and task summaries:
- `todo_summary.txt` - Summary of TODO items

## Usage

These files are analysis outputs and should generally not be edited manually. They are generated by various tools and scripts in the project:

- Coverage reports: Generated by `cargo llvm-cov` and related tools
- Benchmark results: Generated by `cargo bench`
- Analysis files: Generated by custom analysis scripts in `scripts/`

## Notes

- HTML coverage reports in `coverage/` are regenerated on each coverage run
- Benchmark results are timestamped and should be archived periodically
- Analysis files may be regenerated as code evolves
