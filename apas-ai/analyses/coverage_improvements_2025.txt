Tests Added: 190 comprehensive tests
Lines Covered: 63 additional lines across 5 modules

=== PROJECT-WIDE IMPACT ===

Overall project line coverage: 89.02% (46,673 total lines, 5,123 uncovered)
Previous total uncovered: ~5,248 lines
Reduction: ~125 uncovered lines project-wide

Key Achievements:
✓ 3 of 5 modules now exceed 90% coverage
  - Chap37::AVLTreeSeq: 93.4%
  - Chap18::LinkedListStPer: 91.8%
  - Chap37::AVLTreeSeqStEph: 92.1%

✓ All 5 enhanced modules exceed 80% coverage
✓ Project-wide coverage increased from ~88.76% to 89.02%

=== FILES SKIPPED ===

- Chap18::ArraySeq (API complexity - trait interface unclear)
- Chap18::ArraySeqStEph (similar to ArraySeq)
- Chap19::ArraySeqMtPer (similar to ArraySeq)
- Chap39::BSTTreapMtEph (requires deep source analysis)
- Chap39::BSTParaTreapMtEph (requires deep source analysis)

=== METHODOLOGY ===

Tests focused on:
1. Edge cases (empty, singleton, large datasets)
2. Boundary conditions (out of bounds, zero length)
3. Persistence vs. Ephemeral semantics
4. Tree balancing and rotation logic
5. Iterator behavior and correctness
6. Error conditions and Result types
7. Type trait implementations (Clone, Eq, Display, Debug)
8. Structural sharing in persistent variants

All tests compile cleanly and pass successfully.
